# NOT TO BE WRITTEN:
  It was instructed to perform all the lex programs using C.


### Problem Statement:
<center>
  <H1> Write a C Program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string </H1>
</center>

### Algorithm:

1. Create variables to keep track of the counts for vowels, consonants, digits, and spaces. Set all of them to zero initially.
2. Prompt the user to input a line of text (string).
3. Loop through each character in the input string.
4. convert the character to lowercase (to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters).
5. If the character is a vowel (i.e., ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, or ‘u’), increment the vowel count.
6. If the character is an alphabet (i.e., falls between ‘a’ and ‘z’), but not a vowel, increment the consonant count.
7. If the character is a digit (i.e., falls between ‘0’ and ‘9’), increment the digit count.
8. If the character is a space, increment the space count.
9. Display the final counts of vowels, consonants, digits, and spaces.

### Code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main() {
    char line[150];
    int vowels, consonants, digits, spaces;

    vowels = consonants = digits = spaces = 0;

    printf("Enter a line of string: ");
    fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);

    for (int i = 0; line[i] != '\0'; ++i) {
        line[i] = tolower(line[i]);

        if (line[i] == 'a' || line[i] == 'e' || line[i] == 'i' || line[i] == 'o' || line[i] == 'u') {
            ++vowels;
        }
        else if ((line[i] >= 'a' && line[i] <= 'z')) {
            ++consonants;
        }
        else if (line[i] >= '0' && line[i] <= '9') {
            ++digits;
        }
        else if (line[i] == ' ') {
            ++spaces;
        }
    }

    printf("Vowels: %d\n", vowels);
    printf("Consonants: %d\n", consonants);
    printf("Digits: %d\n", digits);
    printf("White spaces: %d\n", spaces);

    return 0;
}

```

### Conclusion:

Above is the algorithm and code to evaluate a statement and display the count of vowels, consonants, digits and white spaces.
