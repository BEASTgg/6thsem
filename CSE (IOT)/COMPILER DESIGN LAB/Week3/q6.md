# NOT TO BE WRITTEN:
  It was instructed to perform all the lex programs using C.


### Problem Statement:
<center>
  <H1> Write a C Program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string </H1>
</center>

### Algorithm:

1. Create variables to keep track of the counts for vowels, consonants, digits, and spaces. Set all of them to zero initially.
2. Prompt the user to input a line of text (string).
3. Loop through each character in the input string.
4. convert the character to lowercase (to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters).
5. If the character is a vowel (i.e., ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, or ‘u’), increment the vowel count.
6. If the character is an alphabet (i.e., falls between ‘a’ and ‘z’), but not a vowel, increment the consonant count.
7. Display the final counts of vowels, consonants, digits, and spaces.

### Code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h> // For tolower() function

int main() {
    char line[150];
    int vowels, consonants;

    // Initialize all variables to 0
    vowels = consonants = 0;

    // Get a full line of string input
    printf("Enter a line of string: ");
    fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);

    // Loop through each character of the string
    for (int i = 0; line[i] != '\0'; ++i) {
        // Convert character to lowercase
        line[i] = tolower(line[i]);

        // Check if the character is a vowel
        if (line[i] == 'a' || line[i] == 'e' || line[i] == 'i' || line[i] == 'o' || line[i] == 'u') {
            ++vowels;
        }
        // If it is not a vowel and an alphabet, it is a consonant
        else if ((line[i] >= 'a' && line[i] <= 'z')) {
            ++consonants;
        }
    }

    printf("Vowels: %d\n", vowels);
    printf("Consonants: %d\n", consonants);

    return 0;
}

```

### Conclusion:

Above is the algorithm and code to evaluate a statement and display the count of vowels and consonants.
