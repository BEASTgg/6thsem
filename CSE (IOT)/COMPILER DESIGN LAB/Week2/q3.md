### Problem Statement:
<center>
  <H1> Write a C program to check if a user given C Program Statement is a valid comment or not? </H1>
</center>

### Algorithm:

1. Open the input file "input.c" in read mode.
2. Check if the file is successfully opened. If not, print an error message and exit the program with a status of 1.
3. Open the output file "output.c" in write mode.
4. Check if the output file is successfully opened. If not, print an error message, close the input file, and exit the program with a status of 1.
5. Use a while loop to read characters from the input file until the end of the file (EOF) is reached.
6. Inside the loop, check if the current character (ch) is a '/'.
7. Handling Single-Line Comments:
8. If yes, read the next character (nextChar).
9. If nextChar is '/', it indicates a single-line comment. Continue reading characters until a newline character or the end of the file is encountered, effectively skipping the comment.
10. If nextChar is '', it indicates the beginning of a multi-line comment. Use a do-while loop to skip characters until the end of the comment (/).
11. If the current character is not '/', write it to the output file.
12. After processing all characters, close both the input and output files.
13. Print a success message indicating that comments have been removed and the result has been written to "output.c".
14. Return 0 to indicate successful execution.

### Code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *inputFile, *outputFile;
    char ch, nextChar;

    inputFile = fopen("input.c", "r");
    if (inputFile == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening input file\n");
        return 1;
    }

    outputFile = fopen("output.c", "w");
    if (outputFile == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening output file\n");
        fclose(inputFile);
        return 1;
    }

    while ((ch = fgetc(inputFile)) != EOF) {
        if (ch == '/') {
            nextChar = fgetc(inputFile);
            if (nextChar == '/') {
                while ((ch = fgetc(inputFile)) != '\n' && ch != EOF);
            }
            else if (nextChar == '*') {
                do {
                    while ((ch = fgetc(inputFile)) != '*');
                } while ((ch = fgetc(inputFile)) != '/');
            }
            else {
                fputc('/', outputFile);
                fputc(nextChar, outputFile);
            }
        }
        else {
            fputc(ch, outputFile);
        }
    }

    fclose(inputFile);
    fclose(outputFile);
    printf("Comments removed and written to output.c successfully.\n");
    return 0;
}

```
