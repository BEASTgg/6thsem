## Write a Lex Program to count the no of comment line in a given C program. Also eliminate them and copy that program into separate file.

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize two counters: m1 for multiline comments and s1 for single-line comments.
2. These counters will keep track of the number of each type of comment encountered.
3. Open the sourcefile.c for reading.
4. Read the file line by line.
5. Multiline comments start with /* and end with */. Single-line comments start with // and continue until the end of the line. Whenever you encounter one of these patterns:
6. Increment the corresponding counter (m1 for multiline or s1 for single-line).
7. Continue reading lines until you reach the end of the file.
8. For each line, check if it contains any comments.
9. If it does, update the counters accordingly.
10. If not, move on to the next line.
11. After processing the entire file, close the input file.
12. “The number of multiline comments = m1”
13. “The number of single-line comments = s1”

### Code:

```lex
%{
#include<stdio.h>
int m1=0, s1=0;
%}

%%
"/*"[a-zA-Z0-9\n\t ]*"*/" {m1++;}
"//"[a-zA-Z0-9\t ]*"\n" {s1++;}
%%

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
	if (argc<2)
	{
		printf("Usage: <a.exe> <sourcefile>\n");
		exit(0);
	}
	yyin = fopen(argv[1],"r");
	yyout = fopen("output.c","w");
	yylex();
	printf("The number of multiline comment = %d\n", m1);
	printf("The number of singleline comment = %d\n", s1);
	fclose(yyin);
	fclose(yyout);
}
int yywrap()
{
	return 1;
}
```

### Output -

```
a.exe a.c
The number of multiline comment = 1
The number of singleline comment = 2
```
