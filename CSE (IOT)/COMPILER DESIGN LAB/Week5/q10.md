## Write a Lex Program to count the no of ‘scanf’ and ‘printf’ statements in a C program. Replace them with ‘readf’ and ‘writef’ statements respectively.

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize two counters: a for printf statements and b for scanf statements.
2. These counters will keep track of the number of each type of statement encountered.
3. Open the sourcefile.c for reading.
4. Read the file line by line.
5.Whenever you encounter the string "printf", Increment the a counter.
6. Whenever you encounter the string "scanf", Increment the b counter.
7. Continue reading lines until you reach the end of the file.
8. After processing the entire file, close the input and output files.
9. “Printf statement count = a”
10. “Scanf statement count = b”

### Codes:

```lex
%{
#include<stdio.h>
int a=0, b=0;
%}

%%
"scanf" {fprintf(yyout,"readf");b++;}
"printf" {fprintf(yyout,"writef");a++;}
%%

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
	if (argc<2)
	{
		printf("Usage: <a.exe> <sourcefile>\n");
		exit(0);
	}
	yyin = fopen(argv[1],"r");
	yyout = fopen("output.c","w");
	yylex();
	printf("Printf statement - %d\n", a);
	printf("Scanf statement - %d\n", b);
	fclose(yyin);
	fclose(yyout);
}
int yywrap()
{
	return 1;
}
```

### Output -

```
a.exe a.c
Printf statement - 1
Scanf statement - 1
```
