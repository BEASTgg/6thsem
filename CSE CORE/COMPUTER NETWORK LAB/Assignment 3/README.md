### Listen just open ubuntu and run those files by first typing the commands in following ways -

#### For Qs 1 -

```
gcc UDPserver.c
```
```
./a.out
```

#### Open another terminal and then run the client file by using the code -

```
gcc UDPclient.c
```
```
./a.out
```

#### For Qs 2 -

```

```

#### Open another terminal and then run the client file by using the code -
