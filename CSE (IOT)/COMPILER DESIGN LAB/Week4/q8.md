## NOT TO BE WRITTEN:
  It was instructed to perform all the lex programs using C.<br><br>
  Believe me, I harbor no animosity towards anyone but lex is an actual compiler based language very hard to simulate with modern code editors because the whole language is very unneeded where C++, Java and Python make up for the majority of actual real-life operations.
  <br>The Code below should use logic only implementable in lex and hence the whole point of writing this code is SIMPLY DUMB.


## Problem Statement:
<center>
  <H1> Write a C Program to count no of: a) +ve and –ve integers b) +ve and –ve fractions </H1>
</center>

### Algorithm:

1. Accept the input data (integers and fractions) from the user or a file.
2. Initialize four counters: posint (positive integers), negint (negative integers), posfraction (positive fractions), and negfraction (negative fractions). Set all counters to zero.
3. For each number in the input data check if it is an integer or a fraction.
4. If it is an integer:
5. If the number is positive, increment posint.
6. If the number is negative, increment negint.
7. If it is a fraction:
8. If the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, increment posfraction.
9. If the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive, increment negfraction.
10. Print the counts of positive and negative integers, as well as positive and negative fractions.

### Code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    int positiveIntegers = 0, negativeIntegers = 0;
    int positiveFractions = 0, negativeFractions = 0;

    printf("Enter the total number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Enter the integers and fractions (separated by space):\n");

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float num;
        scanf("%f", &num);

        if (num > 0) {
            if (num == (int)num) {
                positiveIntegers++;
            } else {
                positiveFractions++;
            }
        } else if (num < 0) {
            if (num == (int)num) {
                negativeIntegers++;
            } else {
                negativeFractions++;
            }
        }
    }

    printf("Positive Integers: %d\n", positiveIntegers);
    printf("Negative Integers: %d\n", negativeIntegers);
    printf("Positive Fractions: %d\n", positiveFractions);
    printf("Negative Fractions: %d\n", negativeFractions);

    return 0;
}

```

### Conclusion:

Above is the algorithm and code to evaluate a statement and display the count of vowels, consonants, digits and white spaces.
